<div>
    This action reschedules failed builds.
    <p>
    Note: immediate rescheduling of failed builds, combined with publishers such as e-mail or IM, will flood the
    recipients. Take care to configure a suitable delay between builds or limit the maximum retries.
    <p>
    Following variables are defined for rescheduled builds.
    <dl>
      <dt>NAGINATOR_COUNT</dt>
        <dd>How many times the build was rescheduled.</dd>
      <dt>NAGINATOR_MAXCOUNT</dt>
        <dd>How many times the build can be rescheduled. This can be 0 if manually rescheduled.</dd>
      <dt>NAGINATOR_BUILD_NUMBER</dt>
        <dd>The build number of the failed build causing the reschedule.</dd>
    </dl>
