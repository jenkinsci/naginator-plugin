    Progressively delay before retrying build. The delay starts at
    <em>increment</em> seconds and grows by <tt>increment * number of
    consecutive failures</tt> up to the maximum value, then remains at
    <em>maximum</em>.
    For example, for increment of 15 seconds and maximum of 90 seconds,
    the delay between builds will be (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 90, 90, ...) seconds.
